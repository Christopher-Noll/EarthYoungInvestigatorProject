# The Last Hurrah!

## Acknowledgements and Thank Yous!
I'm SO SAD that this internship is coming to a close! it has been an AMAZING experience. It feels just like yesterday when I was sitting next to my future friends, meeting Jenny for the first time and learning about the program in the ground level meeting hall. Before I go, I want to say a giant THANK YOU to Noel for his endless baking, assistance, and overall positivity which made coding and learning extremely entertaining! THANK YOU Jenny Saltzman for all your hard work setting up countless amazing experiences for us to enjoy! Your hard work made this program possible. THANK YOU for this incredible opportunity! THANK YOU Dr. Payne for giving us interns valuable feedback about our plots and how to improve going forward! THANK YOU Nic for being a force for good and making sure that we interns had a great time! Finally, THANK YOU to ALL the presenters who shared with us their journey's to Stanford and their current research! You gave us new perspectives about the various studies preformed at a major research university. ***THANK YOU!!***

## For Future, Prospective Interns:

This program is ***DEFINITELY WORTH IT!*** You will do real research and assist graduate students and professors with their research at an ***AMAZING*** university! Although this sounds cheesy and hyperbolic, it's the truth. Where else are you given the opportunity to walk along a beach littered with fossils one day and do intensive R programing the next? The Earth Young Investigator Program is something you won't want to miss and will never forget.

## The Evolution of a Graph:
For fun, here is the evolution of my first ever graph from Version #4 to Version #16!

## Last Thoughts:

The experience of being a Stanford Earth Young Investigator has been utterly unbelievable! THANK YOU to EVERYONE who made this possible! I look forward to applying again next year.

And, as always:
