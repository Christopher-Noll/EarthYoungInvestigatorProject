# Onwards and Upwards: To Pinnacles and Good-Pickings!

## Blog Post (7/13/18), 10:20 A.M.

This week, we were off to Pinnacles National Park! What an ***AWESOME*** experience! We began our journey early Monday, half asleep and ready to catch some shut-eye in the van as we drove down! Our first stop was in *Patriot Park*, a cute, little park in a town surrounded by farming and fields.

Our next stop was to the slides of a cliff, oddly enough, to go fossil mining! it was a great experience!

#### I came back with 2 bags of fossils and a huge rock, full of fossil mollusks!:

## The next stop was the campsite, which, despite annoying flies and wasps trying to steal our food, was a great place and utterly gorgeous at sunset and sundown!

#### Here's a picture of our motley campsite!:

## Then, it was off to do a bit of hiking, see some caves, and witness the beauty of the Park's reservoir!

##### Stepping out of the van, this gorgeous view of the pinkish pinnacles-the namesake of the national park-greeted us!:

## Hiking up trail, it was clear there still much more in store!

## After such a great day, we came back and had chicken fajitas! A great day ended with great food!

## Next day it was off to do a geology hike and climb a mountain! A difficult but great time!

#### The breathtaking view at the top!:

Soon after that we were on our way home: stronger, more knowledgeable of igneous rocks, and ready for another nap!

After that, we were on our way home. It was an ***awesome*** day full of hiking and great fossil finds! Thank you Ms. Saltzman and Mr. Heim for making this amazing camping and hiking trip possible!

Thanks for all the support, and I look forward to the weeks ahead!

And as always:
