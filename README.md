# Christopher Noll's Earth Young Investigator Project
Hello! My name is Christopher Noll, and this page is the collection of my contributions over the Earth Young Investigator Biodiversity Program, Summer 2018.

So far this internship has been great and I look forward to continue to learn and grow throughout my next eight weeks!

Although I see myself more of a vertebrate paleontologist, I am ecstatic to be working with Dr. Heim and my fellow peers on a paper to be published in the fall!

## Take a look at some of my work so far!:
