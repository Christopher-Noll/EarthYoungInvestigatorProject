# **Chris Noll's Earth Young Investigator Project, Summer 2018**
Hello! My name is Christopher Noll, and this page is the collection of my contributions over the *Earth Young Investigator Biodiversity Program*, Summer 2018.

So far this internship has been great and I look forward to continue to learn and grow throughout my next eight weeks!

Although I see myself more of a vertebrate paleontologist, I am ecstatic to be working with Dr. Heim and my fellow peers on a paper, generally about the reasons for change in invertebrate body size, to be published in the fall!
