# Christopher Noll's Earth Young Investigator Project
Hello! My name is Christopher Noll, and this page is the collection of my contributions over the Earth Young Investigator Biodiversity Program, Summer 2018.

So far this internship has been great and I look forward to continue to learn and grow throughout my next eight weeks!
