# ... And Then There Was R

## Blog Post (7/1/18), 9:22 A.M.

  What an ***AMAZING*** experience this has been! I, honestly, have been blown away by the program so far. Learning the programing language R has been a dream of mine which has now become a reality! Additionally, although I hope to pursue vertebrate paleontology, I have found learning more about invertebrate phyla and fossils to be extremely interesting, which has definitely made me rethink my previous plans! Overall, I'm extremely excited to learn more, get to work on our publication, and have a great time forging new friendships and enjoying new experiences.

  Thanks for all the support, and I look forward to the weeks ahead!

  And as always:
